# SakuraPool

Typed P1 reference queries, a P2 local uncompressed TAR index builder, and a P3
read-only runtime (compile committed P2 into a bitmap snapshot, query, resolve).
No data service access, image decoding, production throughput claims, or model
execution.

## Project workflow and boundaries

[Project rules](docs/PROJECT_RULES.md) are the canonical current workflow and
boundary reference. The intended administrator flow is remote TAR indexing →
durable index → runtime compile/verify → versioned index publication. The user
flow is install/verify a published index → query → locate image/JSON → Range
retrieval → a small local dataset. Remote scanning, publication and retrieval
remain future-stage work, not implemented P3 features.

Ordinary users do not need complete local TARs; LocalTarScanner is for local
inputs, testing and validation. No ready-to-import index currently exists; do not
search for old hfutils/CheeseChaser indexes as a prerequisite. Large-repository
index construction requires separate authorization after development and acceptance.
The later P4 integration target is `leafmoone/game_cg_5M`; naming it grants no
access, full scan or write permission. See the rules for bounded canary planning,
object-version binding, component boundaries and dev/main review requirements.

## Installation and CLI

Python 3.10 or newer is required by the code and dependency minimums; there is no
project-imposed upper version bound or mandatory Python 3.12 certification policy.
Use the newest stable interpreter that actually installs and passes verification
with the pinned dependencies, not simply the highest version number. On Windows
x86-64, the current PyArrow 18.1.0 / NumPy 2.2.6 pins provide CPython 3.13 wheels
but not 3.14 wheels. Removing the metadata upper bound does not certify 3.14 or
permit silently upgrading those pins, transplanting Arrow, or using `--no-deps`.

The current single-project-environment selection and independent certification
are recorded in `reports/Python-venv-20260930/`; historical Fix3 Python 3.12 logs
remain unchanged and do not certify this later contract. Verification subprocesses
use the invoking interpreter (`sys.executable`) rather than a retired venv path.

```console
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
sakura --version
sakura config validate --config examples/index-config.json
sakura index scan --config examples/index-config.json --dataset synthetic --input /local/tars --output /local/index
sakurapool validate examples/query.json
sakurapool evaluate examples/query.json examples/rows.json
```

`sakurapool` remains an alias. `index scan INPUT OUTPUT` remains supported. Input may
be one uncompressed TAR or a directory recursively containing TARs. Compression is
rejected by known extension, content magic, and the uncompressed TAR reader, including
compressed content disguised as `.tar`. Inputs/outputs must not overlap.

## P1_CONTRACT_CHANGE

**Original definition:** P1 implemented only `DEFAULT_SCHEMA(id, value, label)` and
query/model/schema registries. It did not implement the required ObjectRef, MemberRef,
RecordKey or namespaced tag contract. Initial P2 incorrectly defined an Object as an
image occurrence, hashed dataset/source/shard/member/extents with SHA256, and made
samples one-to-one with objects. Tags were bare strings.

**Problem:** one TAR contains many physical records; moving extents changed identity;
there were no JSON member extents or registry-defined tag namespace/origin/category.
P1's toy query schema is not evidence that these original domain requirements existed.

**New definition (on-disk schema version 4):** one Object is one TAR shard, identified
by a stable storage profile plus a content-bound object_id. Each successfully paired
physical sample is one samples row; invalid/unpaired candidates produce errors while
required missing metadata retains the sample row.
`RecordKey=(dataset_id, object_id, sample_path)`, where sample_path is the adapter's
full logical member stem, not an image byte offset. `record_id` is exactly:

```python
hashlib.blake2b(json.dumps(
    ["sakurapool-record-v1", dataset_id, object_id, sample_path],
    ensure_ascii=False, separators=(",", ":")
).encode("utf-8"), digest_size=16).hexdigest()
```

The object_path is a canonical relative POSIX path; object_id is content-bound and
includes the SHA256 object version. Canonical paths are nonempty and have no empty,
dot, dot-dot, backslash, or colon components. Noncanonical IDs are rejected, never silently mapped.
Original key fields are retained with every sample/annotation. Duplicate/colliding
keys fail without publishing that shard. This is physical-record identity, not dedup.
`records.ObjectRef` is a self-contained retrieval object descriptor with
`storage_id/object_id/object_path/object_size/object_version/validator/backend/repo_type/
archive_format/validator_kind/validator_strength`; `archive_format` is keyword-only to
preserve the pre-existing positional ObjectRef ABI. `MemberRef` adds member path and
uint64 extent without opening or decoding images. P2 local objects use
`repo_type=local` and `archive_format=tar`; remote revision retrieval is not implemented.

**Migration impact:** version 1 outputs must not be reused. Build a new output directory;
there is no in-place migration. Object IDs, record IDs, table columns, error codes,
summary counts, and crash hooks changed. Existing P1 query APIs remain unchanged but
are not automatically a query engine for the four domain tables. Historical P2 reports
and `tools/verify_p2.py` describe the obsolete v1 protocol, not current certification.

## Four Arrow tables

- **objects:** stable `storage_id` profile, content-bound `object_id`, backend, nullable
  `repo_type`, `archive_format=tar`, dataset, object path/size/version, validator, and scan status. Local absolute build paths are never stored in logical identity.
- **samples:** retained RecordKey and record_id, source/post_id, image path/offset_data/size,
  nullable JSON path/offset_data/size, nullable text and physical image metadata, tags_state,
  tags:list<struct<value, category>>, hash_source and nullable sha256.
  Both image and JSON extents use uint64. No image decoder is imported.
- **annotations:** retained identity plus namespace/origin/tags_state and
  tags:list<struct<value, category>>; one grouped row per record/namespace/origin.
- **errors:** dataset_id, object_id, registry source, member/logical path, code, detail.
  Empty tables retain their exact schema.

Tags states: `known` is a nonempty list of strings, `empty` is `[]`, `missing` has no
configured metadata key, `invalid` has a wrong type. Missing/invalid tags are null.
Tag origin is `declared:json.<field>`; namespace/category come from the adapter.
Metadata SHA256 is only `declared:json.sha256`, never content proof. `--hash-images`
explicitly computes image SHA256 and marks `computed:sha256`. Default scanning does
not separately read images to hash them, **but the strong object validator reads the
whole TAR multiple times** (before scanning, before commit, and final input validation).
Size/mtime are change hints, not strong content proof. Validator version 1 explicitly
names strength `strong:sha256`.

## Registry and pairing

Source is mandatory registry data and never inferred from paths. Pairing preserves the
full logical stem. `image_prefix="images/"` and `metadata_prefix="meta/"` allow
`images/7.jpg` + `meta/7.json` to pair as `7`; remaining directory components are kept.
Prefix removal is explicit and collisions are rejected. `metadata_required` defaults
to true and can be false. `numeric_post_id` optionally requires decimal post stems.
`tags_field`, `text_field`, `max_json_bytes`, `tag_namespace`, `tag_category`, and
`image_extensions` are explicit options; defaults are `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, and `.avif`. README.md/manifest.json, hidden paths,
directories, and unrecognized suffixes are ignored; `ignored_names` is configurable.

Error vocabulary: invalid_post_id, missing_image, missing_metadata, metadata_invalid,
source_mismatch, ambiguous_image_member, ambiguous_metadata_member, unsupported_member,
unsupported_archive, record_identity_conflict. Fatal archive/conflict/storage failures
raise and CLI returns error JSON/nonzero; per-record errors are stored and return 1.
Normal CLI returns 0; argument/fatal errors return 2.

## Publication, resume, and counts

Single writer, quiescent local inputs. Each shard writes four Parquet partial files in
batches, flushes/fsyncs and closes, then renames finals. COMMIT is last, atomically
published after fsync and records file path/size/SHA256/row counts, input validator,
schema/builder/dataset/object and created_at. POSIX fsyncs directories. Windows CRT
has no directory fsync: process recovery is tested, power-loss durability is not promised.
Readers must verify COMMIT before consuming files, never simply glob uncommitted finals.

Crash hooks: A=half samples partial before footer; B=all Parquet closed, no rename;
C=first final rename only; D=all final files without marker; E=marker published.
A–D rebuild; E validates all hashes/schemas/counts before skipping. Corrupt committed
outputs fail `CORRUPT_COMMIT` and are not silently rebuilt. Changed input content,
mtime, inventory, or configuration rejects existing offsets. Only reserved builder
partial names are removed; unrelated user files are preserved. Do not place your own
files in builder-reserved names. COMMIT hashes are not authenticated against an attacker.

Summary objects_seen/objects_committed/objects_skipped count TAR shards. `objects` is
the total shard rows including skipped shards; `samples` counts indexed physical sample
rows, not shards, tags, or invalid candidates. `skipped` is a compatibility alias of
objects_skipped. created_at and timings are nondeterministic; logical rows/IDs/counts
are deterministic. Memory still scales with the largest shard (headers and rows are
materialized); batched Parquet writing is not a bounded-memory streaming claim.

## Verification

```console
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest -q
python -m ruff check .
git diff --check
git diff 52358d6fca728d2bba12814490e0974a6907b218..HEAD --check
python -m build --wheel --outdir /tmp/sakurapool-p2-wheel
PYTHONPATH=src python tools/benchmark_indexer.py
```

The current on-disk contract is `FORMAT_VERSION=4`, builder `sakurapool-p2-v4`.
`storage_id` is a stable configured profile identifier (default `local`), independent of
content-bound `object_id`. ObjectRef carries storage_id, object_id, object_path,
object_size, object_version, and validator. `archive_format=tar` is separate from
`repo_type=local`. Version 3 outputs are incompatible and must not be reused; build a
new output directory. Future ModelScope validation MUST NOT use remote full-object SHA
rereads as the normal validation path; use fixed revisions and object validators.
P4 MUST NOT use remote full-object SHA rereads as the normal ModelScope validation path.

The benchmark generates 10,000 synthetic samples in **one** TAR. It reports
header/json/parquet/total seconds and process peak RSS including fixture generation
and imports; total excludes fixture generation but includes whole-TAR validation.
No production performance inference is valid. See the revision report for actual
command logs, compatible installation failures/successes, and remaining gates.

## P3 runtime

The runtime compiles one or more committed P2 directories into an immutable
snapshot and answers queries from bitmaps without touching original archives.
The runtime format is 2, compiler `sakurapool-p3-v2`; v1 runtime snapshots are
rejected and must be recompiled. P2 durable FORMAT4 is unchanged, including
readability of partition build provenance recording runtime format 1. Snapshot
identity includes runtime format and compiler, so v1 and v2 do not collide.

```console
sakura runtime compile [--index DIR ...] [P2_DIR ...] RUNTIME_ROOT
sakura runtime query RUNTIME_ROOT [--source S] [--dataset D] [--namespace NS]
                 [--all-tag T] [--any-tag T] [--none-tag T] [--limit N] --full
sakura runtime query --snapshot RUNTIME_ROOT --spec SPEC.json
sakura runtime verify RUNTIME_ROOT [--full]
sakura runtime inspect RUNTIME_ROOT [--full]
sakura runtime lookup RUNTIME_ROOT --source SRC --post-id ID [--dataset DS]
```

`query` and `verify/inspect` also accept `--index`/`--snapshot` as aliases for
the positional root; `--spec SPEC.json` reads a spec object (including an
`any_of` list) and cannot be mixed with term flags. An unknown namespace is a
hard error even when no tags are given. `--full` runs the streaming full
verification (payload sha256 of every published file), while a plain open only
checks metadata and identity (below).

Layout per `RUNTIME_ROOT`: `current.json` (atomic pointer) plus
`snapshots/<snapshot_id>/{catalog.sqlite, bitmaps.sqlite, locations.npy,
SNAPSHOT.json, READY}`. Nothing is openable before `READY`; compilation is
stage-resumable (`STAGE.txt` marks stage1/catalog/bitmaps/locations/snapshot/ready).
A second `compile` reuses a published snapshot only after validating the READY
marker, the manifest, and a streamed sha256 of every published file; a broken
`current.json` is repaired, foreign `.staging-<other-id>` directories are never
deleted, and the P2 inventory fails closed on any undeclared file (stray
partials included), on `object_id != rel@sha256(input)`, and on fragment rows
that claim a different (dataset, object). `rid` is a dense `uint32` in
canonical order `(dataset_id, object_id, sample_path, record_id)`.
`locations.npy` is a rid-ordered numpy memmap (`object_idx u4, image_offset u8,
image_size u8, metadata_offset u8, metadata_size u8, format_id u2, flags u1`)
with an 82-byte identity trailer (`SAP3LOC1`, snapshot_id, rid_count) appended
after the payload: a fast open binds the whole file to the snapshot identity
(a same-shape `locations.npy` from another snapshot raises `SnapshotMixError`,
as does a whole-file swap of `bitmaps.sqlite`/`catalog.sqlite`), while an
in-place same-size payload edit is only detected by `--full` streaming
verification. `catalog.sqlite` holds names/IDs (records, sources, datasets,
namespaces, tags, tag_categories) and every lookup resolves via index
(asserted by `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` tests). Tag identity is `(namespace, value)`;
one namespace may be served by multiple sources/origins (bitmap union).
`tags_state in (known, empty)` defines a record's known set; `missing`/`invalid`
records contribute no tags. Categories are metadata: distinct non-null categories
are unioned into `tag_categories(tag_id, category)` (composite primary key,
declared FK to tags, index on `(category, tag_id)`). The compiler explicitly
validates references; it does not rely on SQLite FK enforcement. `tags` has no
category column. Staging `CATEGORIES.json` contains `[tag_id, category]` pairs
sorted by ID then category. `STAGE2-COUNTS.json` reports raw `tag_occurrences`;
formal `tag_memberships` sums final tag bitmap cardinalities, deduplicated across
categories, origins and chunks. `rt.tag_categories(namespace, value)` returns a
sorted tuple (empty for null-only categories); unknown tags/namespaces raise
`UnknownQueryValueError`. No category filter APIs are provided; queries remain
value-based. Offsets/sizes are stored lossless
beyond 2**63 and metadata presence is independent of its size (a zero-length
metadata keeps `HAS_METADATA`). The snapshot fingerprint excludes the P2
`created_at` timestamps by design, so re-timestamped identical inputs produce
the same `snapshot_id`.

Query domain (`RuntimeQuerySpec`): `sources` OR, `datasets` OR, then AND with
per-tag `all_tags`, one OR group of `any_tags`, and per-namespace `none_tags`
(`known_ns − excluded`); `any_of` is a union of flat branches. AND terms are
planned by their stored cardinality before any bitmap loads and materialization
stops once the intersection is empty. `query()` accepts a spec object or
keyword form (`rt.query(sources=..., namespace=..., all_tags=...)`) and returns
a lazy bitmap result: `count()` / `len()`, `iter_rids()`, `limit(n)`,
`iter_location_batches(size)`, `iter_record_batches(size)` (record batches carry
`source_name`/`dataset_name` alongside the numeric IDs); point resolution is
`lookup_rids(source, post_id[, dataset])` / `resolve_one(source, post_id,
[dataset])` (ambiguous matches raise `AmbiguousRecordError`) and
`object_ref(object_idx)` returns the full validated `ObjectRef`. Bitmaps are
cached in a byte-budget LRU (`cache_bytes` on `RuntimeSnapshot.open`, 256 MiB
default) with hits/misses/evictions counters; a single blob larger than the
budget is never cached.

Benchmark (`tools/bench_runtime.py`, synthetic corpus, deterministic seed):

```console
PYTHONPATH=src python tools/bench_runtime.py --workdir build/bench --scale 100k
# scales: 100k (correctness + 300-spec reference differential), 1M, 5M
# phases: gen, compile, query, diff — each phase is a child process, so peak RSS
# is attributed per phase; results merge into build/bench/report.json
```

The current P3 performance evidence is
[`reports/P3/bench-repair/benchmark.json`](reports/P3/bench-repair/benchmark.json),
with methodology and validation in [`reports/P3/report.md`](reports/P3/report.md)
and separate [installed-package evidence](reports/P3/bench-repair/benchmark-installed.json).
Earlier benchmark artifacts are retained as history, not current acceptance evidence.
These results cover synthetic workloads only, not network performance, full-repository
coverage or a guarantee for 21M records. Generator/options/code/environment fingerprints
must match; use a fresh benchmark workdir after workload changes rather than assuming
old phase files automatically invalidate. Do not rerun large benchmarks without the
applicable stage authorization.
